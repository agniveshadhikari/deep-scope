# TODO 
# 1. Normalization of amplitude

# 2. Low pass filter
# 3. High pass filter
# 4. Band-pass filter
# TODO: Find out if 2, 3, 4 reduce the time to compute the spectrogram, or
#       it makes more sense to just slice the spectrogram instead of using
#       frequency domain filters.

# 5. Center data around zero and normalize scaling accross axes
